# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to work with Bobby to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help Bobby’s manager prepare for the “silver tsunami” as a lage number of current employees reach retirement age shortly.

## Results

* A large number of Staff and Senior Staff are set to be part of the "Silver Tsunami"
* Senior staff form the highest count of employees eligible for the mentorship program
* Assistant Engineer form the lowest count of emloyees eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary

![Analysis](/retiring_titles.PNG)

* A total of 90,398 roles would be vacated and would need to be filled as the "Silver Tsunami" takes effect
* There are not enough mentorship ready employees in several departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees

### Additional analysis

* There can be some insights drawn from the salaries table to determine what would be the cost recovered by Pewlett-Hackard post the "Silver Tsunami"
* The same table can help us determine if we can pay a mentorship bonus (for relatively lower earning employees) to employees involved in the planned mentoring program

The additional queries can be found in the extraqueries.sql file.
